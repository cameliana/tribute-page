# Tribute Page for Amelia Earhart
In this Responsive Web Design certification project, I crafted a Tribute Page dedicated to the iconic aviator Amelia Earhart. The page serves as a homage to her achievements in aviation during the 20th century.

The page showcased through a visually appealing and user-friendly layout and employs responsive design principles. The layout is structured using HTML and enhanced with CSS styles to create an aesthetically pleasing and accessible tribute to this aviation pioneer.
