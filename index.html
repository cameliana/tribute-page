            <h2>A Trailblazing Aviator</h2>
            <p>Amelia Earhart, a pioneering aviator of the 20th century, captivated the world with her daring spirit and groundbreaking 
        achievements in aviation.</p>
            <p>Born on July 24, 1897, in Atchison, Kansas, Amelia would go on to become one of the most iconic figures 
        in the history of aviation.</p>

        <div id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Amelia's fascination with flying began at an early age. Her interest was sparked when she attended an air show in California 
                in 1920. This experience ignited a passion that would define the rest of her life. Her journey into aviation started 
                in 1921 when she began taking flying lessons, and just a year later, she set the world record for female altitude at 14,000 feet.

        <div id="achievements">
            <h2>Transatlantic Achievements</h2>
            <p>Amelia's name became synonymous with record-breaking flights. In 1928, she became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic 
                Ocean, albeit as a passenger. 
            </p>
            <p>It was in 1932 that she achieved an extraordinary feat by becoming the first woman to 
                fly solo across the Atlantic. This solo flight from Newfoundland to Ireland marked a historic moment in aviation, solidifying 
                Earhart's status as a trailblazer.
